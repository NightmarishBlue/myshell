# myshell
## the shell i built in a week and had to document for a month ðŸ™‚

Commandline UNIX shell that boasts:
- Standard I/O redirection
- Background execution of jobs
- Configurability via ~/.mshrc
- (limited) environment variable expansion
- Shell aliases!

Run `make build` and check `bin/` for the binary.

If you are looking for msh's manual, try looking in `manual/`.
